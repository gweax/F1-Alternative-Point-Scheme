Formula 1 Alternative Point Scheme

For a long time, I have been wondering if there were different Formula 1 champions if only the point scheme was different. When I found the Ergast Developer API (http://ergast.com/mrd/) I knew I could write my own tool to actually check it out.

So I did. Interestingly, there is no much difference. See for yourself.
